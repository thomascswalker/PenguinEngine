# Penguin Engine

## Requirements
- C++ 20
- Visual Studio 2022
- CMake 3.30
- Git

Currently this only runs on Windows. In the future I plan to add support for Linux and MacOS.

## Setup
In the root directory of the repository, run `Setup.sh`
Alternately, open the root directory in a terminal window and run `sh Setup.sh`.

Once the setup has run, you can find the `PenguinEngine.sln` solution inside the `Build` directory.
