# Penguin Engine

## Requirements
- C++ 20
- Visual Studio 2022
- CMake 3.30
- Git

Currently this only runs on Windows. In the future I plan to add support for Linux and MacOS.

## Building the project from source
1. Open the root directory in a terminal window and run `Setup.sh`.
3. Open the `PenguinEngine.sln` solution inside the `Build` directory.
